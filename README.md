Serverless Task

I first set up the serverless using the following command in my terminal: npm install -g serverlesst , and I set up the AWS credintials and I added AWS as a provider in my serverless account .
After installation was complete, I added a few lines to the method to catch the numbers from the request body
Using JSON input and JSON.parse I had the two numbers
and in the return, I just modified the message to reflect the sum of the two values.
